HoneyBee Oral Bible Translation tool

Direction for HoneyBee development:
Those familiar with StoryPublisher will notice as they go through the concept design slides below, that HoneyBee and SPadv are very similar.  There are changes to be sure, especially on T&R and AC phases, but a vast majority of it is very similar.  So, we will be starting with the SPadv code as our base.  Also, we will be using the JSON template file, keeping as many of the tag names the same as possible.
